# Rock Classification


A project I coded while working at Aremak, Turkey.



## What it does
1) Firstly, it connects to an external camera that is attached to the computer. The camera should have the rocks to classify in its view.

2) Then, you can choose to train data by taking pictures of your rock samples or classify when sufficient training data has been acquired.

3) With classification, it can classify the different types of rocks by using their HSV color values.


## How to use
1) Install the dependencies like numpy, pandas, sklearn.
   
2) Make sure the external camera is connected and setup with proper lighting/exposure.
   
3) Run myCode.py and choose either training or classification.

4) A window will pop up, you can click on the region which you want to scan for training/classification.
